# Defective-Solar-Cell
This project aims at identifying defective solar modules in electroluminescence (EL)images.
In general, defects in solar modules can be classified into two categories (1) intrinsic deficiencies due to material properties such as crystal grain boundaries and dislocations, and (2) process-induced extrinsic defects such as microcracks and breaks, which reduce the overall module efficiency over time.
A VGG-19 cnn model was used for the task at hand.To train the data, we had EL images of about 280 solar modules, from which about 2800 individual solar cell images have been extracted, which was further divided into 1950 images as training dataset and 850 images as testing data.

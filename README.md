# Defective-Solar-Cell
This project aims at identifying defective solar modules in electroluminescence (EL)images.
A VGG-19 architecture was used for the task at hand. To train the mode, we had EL images of about 280 solar modules, from which about 2800 individual solar cell images have been extracted, which was further divided into 1950 images as training dataset and 850 images as testing data.
The model was able to detect defective solar cells with an accuracy of 80%.
